We use Soft Wash techniques to help keep the integrity of your roof. We can also treat for moss growth. While some of this is dirt, dust and pollen, much of it is lichen and algae. And while the dirt may wash off the next time it rains, the algae is there to stay. This can make your home look much older and detract from the overall appearance. Not only that, but algae and lichen can shorten the lifespan of your roof, causing you to replace your shingles more often. If you notice your roof beginning to look streaked and dark",
